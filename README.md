because sometimes you need to output a file

and KDL is really nice

knuffel or kdl-rs for deserialization :-)
because sometimes you need to input a file

This is a small builder made to help one dynamically
build out a KDL file with Rust.*
- For now, the only thing _this_ crate does is build the Object.
- One could reimplement display functions for their structs.
- Then anywhere you output, it's kdl.

*** Author is new to rust, this is a side project,
any advice on improving the ergonomics or practices
would be appreciated ***
